## 1.3Vehicle Strengths
*  Chassis and Mechanism : Our vehicle was meticulously built from scratch, utilizing CNC-machined and 3D-printed parts. We also incorporated components from the EV3 Lego kit for critical mechanisms, such as the steering system and differential.

* Speed: Powered by a 24-volt lithium battery, our car achieves impressive speeds, giving it a competitive edge in performance.

* Mobility and Flexibility: The differential system significantly enhances the vehicle's ability to maneuver, providing smooth and flexible turns.

* Acceleration: The car boasts excellent acceleration, thanks to a well-calibrated gear ratio of 1.4:1 and a high-torque gear system that delivers powerful performance.

 ## 2. Programming Languages
We utilized C++ for coding the Arduino, ensuring efficient and reliable control of the hardware. Additionally, we employed Python to code the Raspberry Pi, particularly for implementing OpenCV with the Pi Camera.

## 3. The First Chassis
Initially, we decided to modify an RC car by adding the necessary components and creating a second layer to put them on. However, we encountered several challenges. The first issue arose when trying to create proper holes for mounting the servo motor. This led to further complications when attempting to implement a rack and pinion steering system (you can view the FreeCAD models for the rack and pinion in the "Models" section of this repository) using an MG699R servo motor.

Due to the high power and torque of the servo, it couldn't stay securely in place and kept shifting, which compromised the stability of the steering system. As a result, we decided to move on to our next plan: building a new chassis from scratch.

## 4. Programming Challenges
##Detecting Turns and Direction
In the WRO Future Engineers competition, the car's direction isn't fixed—it can move either clockwise or counterclockwise, adding complexity to navigation. This unpredictability is particularly challenging when the car needs to execute precise U-turns at specific points on the track.

### First Solution: Using the TCS3200 Color Sensor
* Color Detection: We initially programmed the TCS3200 sensor to identify specific colors on the track. An orange line signaled that the car should turn clockwise, while a blue line indicated a counterclockwise turn.

* Controlled Turning: Upon detecting a color, the car was instructed to turn at a specific angle. This angle was precisely controlled using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), ensuring the car made accurate and consistent turns, regardless of external factors like speed or track conditions.

* Code Implementation: The process was automated through predefined functions such as detectOrangeLine and detectBlueLine, which triggered the appropriate turning actions based on the color detected.

This approach provided a straightforward method for determining the car's direction based on visual cues from the track, with the IMU ensuring precise turning control. However, this solution proved suboptimal due to the car's high speed and the limitations of the TCS3200, which was not the best choice for color detection in this context.

### Second Solution: Using Three Ultrasonic Sensors
* Direction Determination: We implemented three ultrasonic sensors to guide the car's movement based on real-time distance measurements. These sensors were strategically positioned to monitor distances on the left, right, and front of the car. When a turn was required, the direction was determined by comparing the distances detected by the sensors:

* If the right sensor measured a greater distance than the left sensor, the car would turn clockwise.
* Conversely, if the left sensor detected a greater distance, the car would turn counterclockwise.
#### Front Sensor Activation:
The front ultrasonic sensor played a critical role in detecting when the car was approximately 50 cm away from an obstacle or a turning point. This detection served as a trigger for the car to initiate the turn.

This approach emphasized spatial awareness and precise distance measurement, allowing the car to make informed directional decisions based on its environment rather than relying on visual cues. Ultimately, we decided that this solution was the most effective for our needs.

## 5.Lap Counting Mechanism:
#### Loop-Based Counting with Ultrasonic Sensor and IMU

##### Overview:
This method utilizes a software-based loop counter to track lap completion. The robot employs an ultrasonic sensor to detect when a lap is completed. If the sensor measures a distance of less than 50 cm to a specified point or object, the system registers the start of a new lap. The robot's steering is precisely managed by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), ensuring accurate navigation during turns.

## IMU-Based Steering
#### Overview: 
In our autonomous vehicle, precise steering control is essential for accurate navigation. We achieve this through an IMU-based steering mechanism. The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) supplies real-time data on the vehicle’s angular velocity, which is crucial for calculating the yaw angle (the vehicle's turning angle) and ensuring stable and accurate steering.

#### Understanding the IMU:
An IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) integrates several sensors, typically including a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. These components work together to monitor the vehicle's movement and orientation in three-dimensional space.

* Accelerometer: Measures acceleration along the X, Y, and Z axes, which helps determine the vehicle’s tilt and linear movement.
* Gyroscope: Measures angular velocity (the rate of rotation) around the X, Y, and Z axes, providing critical information for understanding rotational motion, especially the yaw angle.
#### The X, Y, and Z Axes: 
Understanding these axes is fundamental for interpreting IMU data:

* X-Axis: Represents roll, the tilting motion of the vehicle from side to side.
* Y-Axis: Represents pitch, the tilting motion of the vehicle from front to back.
* Z-Axis: Represents yaw, the rotational movement around the vertical axis, crucial for steering as it defines the vehicle’s direction of travel.
#### Calculating the Yaw Angle: 
The yaw angle (
�
�
θ 
z
​
 ) quantifies the vehicle's rotation around the Z-axis. The IMU’s gyroscope provides angular velocity data along this axis, indicating the rate of rotation.

To determine the vehicle's heading, we calculate the yaw angle by integrating the angular velocity over time. This calculation updates continuously to maintain precise tracking of the vehicle’s direction.

The yaw angle is computed using the following equation:

\theta_z = \theta_{z, \text{previous}} + \left( \frac{\text{gyro}_z - \text{gyro_z_offset}}{131.0} \right) \times \Delta t

Where:

�
�
θ 
z
​
  is the current yaw angle.
�
�
,
previous
θ 
z,previous
​
  is the yaw angle from the previous time step.
gyro
�
gyro 
z
​
  is the angular velocity around the Z-axis, provided by the gyroscope.
\text{gyro_z_offset} is the gyroscope offset, determined during calibration to correct for any drift.
Δ
�
Δt is the time elapsed between the current and previous readings.
### Importance of Gyro Offset:
The gyroscope offset (\text{gyro_z_offset}) is vital as gyroscopes can experience slight errors or biases over time, known as drift. By calculating and subtracting this offset, we ensure that the yaw angle calculation remains accurate, preventing gradual deviations from the true value.

## 6. Obstacle Avoidance Round Challenge
In this round, we integrated the Pi camera to enable the car to navigate between obstacles more efficiently. We started by developing the optimal code to achieve the best resolution and frame rate, while also fine-tuning color filters to ensure precise detection of red and green obstacles. This setup allows the car to identify and respond to obstacles accurately, minimizing the risk of errors. 
Here, you can see the code we developed to optimize the color filters, ensuring the highest accuracy in obstacle detection. This code is tailored to deliver the best possible resolution and frame rate, allowing our car to efficiently identify and respond to red and green obstacles with minimal errors.
